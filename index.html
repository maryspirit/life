			<h2>The Fundamental Unit of Life</h2>

			<p>While examing a thin slice of cork,Robert Hooke saw that the cork resembled the structure of a honeycomb consisting of many little compartments.Cork is a substance which comes from the bark of a tree.This was in the year 1665 when Hooke made this chance observation through a self-designed microscope.Robert Hooke called these boxes cells.Cell is a latin work for 'a little room'.</p><br>

			<p>This may seem tobe a very small and insignificant incident but it is very important  in the history of science.This was the very first time that someone had observed that living things  appear to consist of seperate units.The use of the word 'cell' to describe these units is used till this day in biology.All organisms  around us are made up of cells.</p><br>

			<p>Cells were first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665.He observed the cells in a cork slice with the help of a primitive  microscope.Leeuwenhoek with the improved microscope,discovered the free living cells in pond water for the first time.It was Robert Brown in 1831 who discovered who discovered  the nucleus in the cell.Purkinje in 1839 coined the term 'protoplasm'  for the fluid  substance of the cell.The cell theory ,that all the plants and animals are composed of cells and that cell is the basic unit of life,was presented by two biologists.Schleiden (1838) and Schwann (1839).The cell theory was further expanded by Virchow (1855) by suggesting tht all cells arise from pre-existing cells.With the discovery of the electron microscope in 1940,it was possible to observe and understand the complex structure of the cell and its various organelles.</p><br>

			<p>The invention of magnifying lenses led to the discovery of the microscopic world.It is now known that a single cell may constitute a whole organism as in Amoeba,Chlamydomonas,Paramoecium and bacteria.These organisms are called unicellular organisms.On the other hand,many cell group together in a  single body and assume different functions in it to form various body parts in multicellular organisms such as some fungi,plants and animals.Every multi-cellular  organism gas come from a single cell.Cells divide  to  produce cells of their own kind.All cells thus come from pre-existing cells.</p><br>

			<p>The shape and size of cells are related tonthe specific function they perform.Some cells like Amoeba have changing shapes.In some cases the cell shape could be more or less.Each living cell has the capacity to perform certain basic functions that are characteristic  of all living organisms.We kow that there is a division of labour in multicellular  organisms such as human beings.This means that different parts of the human body  perform different functions.The human body has a heart  to pump blood whereas a stomach to digest food and so on.Similiarly,division of labour is also seen within  a single cell.In fact,each such cell has got certain specific  components within  within it known as cell organelles.Each kind of cell organelle performs a specific function.A cell is able  to live and perform all its functions because of these organelles.These organelles together constitute the basic unit called the  cell.It is intersting that all cells are found to have the same organelles,no matter what their function is or what organism they are found in.</p><br>


			<h3>WHAT IS A CELL MADE UP OF?WHAT IS THE STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION OF A CELL?</h3>

			<p>If we study a cell under the microscope,we would come across  three features in almost every cell;plasma,membrane,nucleus and cytoplasm.All activities inside the cell and interactions of the cell with its environment ae possible due to these features.</p><br>


			<h3>PLASMA MEMBRANE OR CELL MEMBRANE</h3>
			<p>This is the outer most covering of the cell that seperates the contents of the cell from its  external environment.The plasma membrane  allows or permits  the entry and exit of some materials in and out of the cell.It also prevents movement of some other materials.The cell membrane ,therefore,is called a selectively permeable membrane.</p><br>

			<p>Some substances line carbon dioxide or oxygen can move across the cell membrane by a process called diffusion.There is a spontenous movement of a substance from a region where its concentration is low.Water also obeys the law of diffusion The movement of water molecules  through such a selectively permeable membrane is called osmosis.The movement of water across the plasma membrane is also affected  by the amount of substance dissolved in water.Thus,osmosis is the passage of water from a region of high water concentration through a semi-permeable membrane to a region of low water concentration.Thus,osmosis is a special case of diffusion through a selectively permeable membrane.</p><br>

			<p>Unicellular freshwater organismsand most plant cells tend to gain water through osmosis.Absorption of water by plant roots is also an example of osmosis.Thus,diffusion is important  in exchange  of gases and water in the life  of a cell.In additions to this,the cell also obtains nutrition from its environment .Different molecules move in and out of the  cell through a type of transport requiring  use of energy.The plasma membrane is flexible  and is made up of organic  molecules called lipids and proteins,However,we can observe  the  structure of plasma membrane only through  an electron microscope.The flexibilty of the cell membrane also enables  the cell to engulf in food and other material fromits external environment..Such processes are known as endoytosis.Amobea acquires its food through such processes.</p><br>


			<h3>CELL WALL</h3>

			<p>Plant cells,in addition to the plasma membrane,have another rigid outer covering called the cell wall.The cell wall lies outside the plasma membrane.The plant cell wall is mainly composed of cellulose.Cellulose is a complex substance and provides structural strength to plants.When a living plant cell loses water through osmosis there is shrinkage or contraction of the contents of the cell away from the cell wall.This phenomenon is known as plasmolysis.</p><br>

			<h3>NUCLEUS</h3>
			<p>The nucleus has a doule layered  covering  called nuclear membraneThe nuclear membrane has pores which allow  the transfer  of material from inside the nucleus to its outside,that is,to the cytoplasm.The nucleus  contains chromosomes,which are visible as rod-shaped structures  only when the cell is about to divide.Chromosomes contain information for inheritance  of features  from parents to next generation in the form of DNA molecules.Chromosomes are compsed DNA  and protein.DNA molecules contain the information necessary for constructing  and organising cells.Functional segments of DNA are called  genes.Ina cell which is not dividing,this DNA is present a prt of chromatin material.Chromatin material is visible as entangled mass of thread like structures.Whenever thecell is about to divide,the chromatin material gets organized  into chromosomes.</p><br>

			<p>The nucleus plays a central role in cellular reproduction,the process by which a single cell divides and form two new cells.It also plays a crucial part,along  with the  environment,in determining the way the cell will develop and what form it will exhiit at maturity,by directing the chemical activities of the cell.</p><br>

			<h3>CYTOPLASM</h3>
			<p>When we look at the temporary mounts  of onion peel as well as human cheek cells,we can see a large region of each cell  enclosed by the cell membrane.This region takes up very little stain.It is called the cytoplasm.The cytoplasm is the fluid content inside the plasma membrane.It also contains  many specialised cell organelles.Each of these organelles performs a specific function for the cell.Cell organelles are enclosed by membranes.In prokaryotes,beside the absence of a defined nuclear region,the membrane-bound cell organelles are also absent.On the other hand,the eukaryotic cells have nuclear membrane-enclosed organelles.</p><br>

			<h3>CELL ORGANELLES</h3>
			<p>Every cell has a membrane  around it to keep its own contents seperate from the external environment.Large and complex cells,including cells from multicellular organisms,need a lot of chemical activities to support their complicated structure and function.To keep these activities of different kinds seperate form each other,these cells use membrane-bound little structures within themselves.This is one of the features of the eukaryotic cells that distinguish them from prokaryotic cells.Some of these organelles are visible only with an eletron microscope.</p><br>


			<h3>ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER)</h3>

			<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a large network of membrane-bound tubeds and sheets.It looks like long tubules or round or oblong bags.The ER membrane is similiar in structure to the plasma membrane.There are two types of ER-rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum(SER).RER looks rough under a microscope because it has particles called ribosomes attached to its surface.The ribosomes,which are present in all active cells,are the sites of protein manufacture.The manufacturef proteins are then sent to various places in the cell depending on need,using the ER.The SER helps in the manufacture of fat molecules or lipids important for cell function.Some of these proteins and lipids help in building the cell membrane.This process is known as membrane biogenesis.Some other proteins and lipids function as enzymes ad horomones.Although the ER varies greatly in appearance in different cells.It always forms a network system.</p><br>

			<p>Thus,one function of the ER is to serve as channels for the transport of materials between various regions of the cytoplasm or between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.Tge ER also functions as a cytoplasmic framework providing a surface for some of the biochemical activities of the cell.In the liver cells of the group of animals called vertebrates.SER  plays a crucial role in detoxifying many poisons and drugs.</p><br>


			<h3>GOLGI APPARATUS</h3>
			<p>The golgi apparatus,first described by Camillo Golgi,consists of a system of membrane-bound vesicles arranged approximately parallel toeach other in stacks  called cisterns.These membranes often have connections with the membranes of ER and therefore constitute another portion of  complex cellular membrane system.The material synthessised near the ER is packaged and dispatched to various targets inside and outside the cell through the Golgi apparatus.It's functions include the storage,modification and packaging  of products in vesicles.In some cases,complex sugars may be made from simple sugars in the Golgi appartus.The Golgi apparatus is also involved in the formation of lysosomes.</p><br>

			<h3>LYSOSOMES</h3>
			<p>Lysosomes are a kind of waste disposal system of the cell.Lysosomes help to keep the cell clean by digesting any foreign material as well as worn-out  cell organelles.Foreign materials entering  the cell,such as bacteria or food,as well as old  organelles end up  in the lysosomes,which break them up into  small pieces.Lysosomes are able to do this  because they contain powerful digestive  enzymes capable of breaking down all organic material.During the disturbance in cellular metabolism.Lysosomes are membrane -bound sacs filled with digestive enzymes.These enzymes are made by RER.</p><br>

			<h3>MITOCHONDRIA</h3>
			<p>Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell.The energy required for various chemical activities needed for life is released by mitochondria in the form of ATP molecules.ATP is known as the energy  currency  of the cell.The body uses energy stored in ATP for making new chemicalcompounds and for mechanical work.Mitochondria have two membrane  coverings instead of just one.The outer membrane is very porous while the inner membrane is deeply folded.These folds create a large surface area for ATP-generating chemical reactions.Mitochondria are strange organelles in the sense that they have their own DNA abd ribosomes.Therefore,mitochondria are able to make some of their own proteins.</p><br>

			<h3>PLASTIDS</h3>
			<p>Plastids are present only in plant cells.There are two types of plastids-chromoplasts and leucoplasts.Plastids containing the pigment chlorophyll are known as chloroplasts.Chloroplasts are important  photosynthesis in plants.Chloroplasts  also contain various yellow or orange pigments in addition to chlorophyll.Leucoplasts are primiarly organelles in which materials such as starch,oils and protein granules are stored.The internal organisation of the plastids consists ofnumerous membrane layers embedded in the material called the stroma.Plastids are similiar to mitochondria in external structure.Like the mitochondria,plastids also have their own DNA and ribosomes.</p><br>

			<h3>VACUOLES</h3>
			<p>Vacuoles are storage sacs for solid or liquid contents.Vacuoles are small sized in animal cells while plant cells have very large vacuoles.The central vacuole of some plant cells may occupy 50-90% of the cell volume.In plant cells vacuoles are full of cell sap and provide turgidity and rigidity to the cell.Many substances of importance in the life of the plant cell are stored in vacuoles.These include amino acids and some proteins.In single-celles organisms like Amoeba,the food vacuole contains the food items that the Amoeba has consumed.In some  unicellular  organisms,specialised vacuoles also play important roles in expelling excess water and some wastes from the cell.</p>
